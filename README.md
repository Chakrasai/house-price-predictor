# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates house prices based on various features.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment of the prediction model

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.9
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chakrasai/house-price-predictor.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
4. Make predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```
